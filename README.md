# ngSkeleton

Useful and simple workaround for your Angular v1.5 app based on [angular-webpack](https://github.com/preboot/angular-webpack)
with some extra-addons:

* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) ES6 support
* [Jade](https://pugjs.org/) layout preprocessor (now it's known as Pug. What a stupid name, isn't it?)
* [Less](http://lesscss.org/) stylesheets preprocessor
* Simple and clear app file structure
* Proper `.gitignore` file to keep your repo clean and shiny
* [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) ruleset based on `airbnb-base` ruleset (you may change it on your own view)

### Quick start


```bash
# clone repo
$ git clone https://github.com/b-ff/ng-skeleton.git my-app

# change directory to your app
$ cd my-app

# install the dependencies with npm
$ npm i

# start the server
$ npm start
```

go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.
(host and port are configured on top of webpack config)

And let the force be with you...
